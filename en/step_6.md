## Restore Raspbian

Now you can restore Raspbian using NOOBS. 

+ When your Raspberry Pi reboots you will see a white splashscreen. Press the left or right shift key on the keyboard to enter NOOBS. The shift keys will have an up arrow on them. 

+ If you miss the prompt and don't manage to get into NOOBS then Raspbian will load and you can repeat the previous step for another chance. 

+ When you get into NOOBS you will see the same menu that you used to install Raspbian. Make sure the Raspbian option that you want is selected and click 'Install'. 

+ You will be warned that you will lose all of your data if you proceed. 

+ NOOBS will replace your Raspbian installation with a clean installation and you can go through the configuration process.

+ You will see that the task bar and main menu are back.
