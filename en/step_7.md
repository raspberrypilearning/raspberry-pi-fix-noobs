## Restore Your Files

Now you can restore your files. 

+ Place your USB drive into one of the USB slots on the Raspberry Pi. 

+ Copy across the files that you need. You can either replace your whole user folder or just the specific files that you need. 

+ If you created a zip file of your user folder then you can copy it to your new user folder and then right click on it to extract it. 

+ Remember that configuration files are stored in the hidden '.config' directory and you may need to restore files in this directory to restore settings for Raspbian or specific apps.
