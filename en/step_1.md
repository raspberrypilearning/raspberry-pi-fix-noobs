## Introduction

Raspbian is the recommended operating system for the Raspberry Pi computer. If you installed Raspbian using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} then you will already have a way to easily carry out a fresh instllation of Raspbian if something goes wrong and be up and running again in no time. The Raspberry Pi computer is designed for trying things out and learning about computing. You are encouraged to make changes to your Raspberry Pi. Sometimes you might accidentally break an important part of the setup. That's okay. As long as you make sure that you always back up important work, you'll be able to quickly get back to a working system.

In this project you'll learn how deliberately break your installation of Raspbian and then quickly get back to a working system. If you work through this project then you'll be prepared if you accidentally break your Raspbian installation in future and you'll also learn more about how Raspbian and the Raspberry Pi Imager work.

We will cover backing up your work but it's highly recommended that you use a spare SD card for this project rather than one you rely on.

### Hardware

+ A Raspberry Pi computer accessories
+ A micro SD Card of at least 8MB capacity. If you are buying a new SD Card then it is probably worth getting one with at least a 16GB capacity. 
+ A backup drive for backing up files. This could be a removable drive such as a USB drive or you can back up to cloud storage.

### Software

+ [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"}
