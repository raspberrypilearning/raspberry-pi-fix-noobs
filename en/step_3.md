## Backup your user files

Before breaking your Raspbian installation you should back up your files. If you have a new installation for this project then you'll create some files so that you still get to learn how to backup and restore your work.

+ Files that you create are stored in your home directory and its subdirectories (folders). 

+ Configuration files for Raspbian and for applications are also stored in your home directory. Change the colour of your desktop. 

+ Create a text file. 

+ Open the File Explorer. 

+ Insert a USB drive and open it in the File Explorer. If you accidentally close the File Explorer for the USB drive you can open it from its icon on the desktop. 

+ Optionally, you can create a zip archive of your home directory to save storage space. 

+ Drag either the zip file or the 'pi' directory to your USB drive in the File Explorer. 

+ When the files have finished copying, click the Eject icon on the System Bar and remove the USB drive. 

+ You can check the contents of the USB drive on another computer (such as a Windows, Mac or Linux computer) if you want to be sure your files have successfully been saved.
