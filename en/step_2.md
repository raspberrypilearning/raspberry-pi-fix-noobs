## Installing NOOBS

To complete this project you'll need an installation of NOOBS. NOOBS stands for New Out Of the Box Software and is an easy operating system installer for beginners. NOOBs allows you to just copy a zip file onto an SD Card and put it into a Raspberry Pi to get up and running. NOOBs stores files on the SDCard so it can restore your operating system if things go wrong. 

If you already have a micro SD Card with NOOBs that you are willing to break then you can continue to the next step. 

For this project we recommend using NOOBs lite because you can choose a smaller desktop installation of Raspbian which will be faster to install and restore. When you're finished with this project then you can install Raspbian Full with all the recommended applications. 

+ Download NOOBS Lite from [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) and copy it to an empty SD Card. 

Choose the *Raspbian* option. Don't choose Raspbian Full at this stage as it will take longer to download and install. Don't choose Raspbian Lite as this does not have the graphical desktop environment. 

You can find more detailed instructions for installing NOOBS below, but we recommend using NOOBS Lite with the Raspbian install option for this project. Choosing NOOBS or Full Raspbian will work but the download and install steps will take longer.

+ After installation you will enter the Raspbian desktop and begin configuration. You will have the option to update your installation. This is not necessary for this project so choose the Skip option to save time.
